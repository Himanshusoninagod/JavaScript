* What is scripting language?
 A type of programming language designed for automating tasks and often used in contexts like web development and system administration. Unlike compiled languages (like C++), scriptinng       languages are interpreted, meaning their code is translated into machine code and executed line by line at runtime.

A scripting language is a programming language designed for integrating and communicating with other programming languages. 


* Output Statements--

  console.log("heyy from external js")
  document.write("With document write")
  alert("Warning")

* input statement--
  var a = prompt("Enter value")

* Variable--
  we have 3 types of variable in javascript-- var, let, const

  1. Var--(Global Scope)
     if we use "var" than we can reassign and redeclear(same variable name) the value of a variable.
     example -
     var num=10
     var num=12

  2. Let--(local Scope)
     if we use "let" than we can reassign the value and can not redeclear(same variable name)
     example--
     let n=10
     n=12

   3. const--(local Scope)
      if we use "const" than we can not reassign the value and can not redeclear (same variable name)

*  Operators-
   special types of symbols are called operators. that we use for operators
   there are 3 types of operators--

   1. Unary--(++ --)

   2. Binary--
      Arithmetic-- (+ - * /)
      Assignment-- (= += -= *= /=)
      Relational-- (> < >= <= == === !=)
      Logical-- (&& || !)

   3. Turnary-- (? :)
      this is use for single line conditional statement.

loops in java script--
1. do while 
2. while
3. for 
4. for of
5. for in
